# Discourse-Graph-Discotech

Welcome to our discotech gallery. Over one weekend, we gathered to build on the Discourse Graph format to expand the number of people involved. 

## Here's what we built

## The problem

Making sense of the state of the art in scientific literature (let alone contributing to it) is a cumbersome and faulty exercise. Most of the world’s domain knowledge is scattered across the web as PDFs, living who knows where and containing who knows what. How can we better “read the literature” and connect the dots between ideas?

​Today, we mostly accomplish this by building citation trees and mapping public domain articles by topical similarity. But imagine the progress we’d make if we could easily traverse a map of smaller units than the papers themselves - a map of the details we actually want to connect. Instead of a map of article citations, we envision a world where researchers can traverse the claims and supporting evidence made across those articles.

​Discourse graphs are the ontology we are describing here. Ultimately, a discourse graph is a series of links between these much smaller units of the research process - questions, claims, evidence, and sources.

​With the help of embedding models, large language models, and natural language interfaces, we are setting out to build tools that create these graphs and help researchers engage with them…so that we can all get more out of the literature!

## What happened
Over three days, we gathered at [fractal tech hub]{https://fractalbootcamp.com/office} to build with researchers, artists, and coders. We kicked the first night off by collecting all the ways we thought we might be able to build tools
